# IEEE-Implicit-Segmentation

In this repository, only 3 audio files are added, described in Spanish but with their digital audio in the "Yuhmu" language, considering that the audio database is not publicly available.
The presented audio samples take into account segmentation and phonetic occurrence for their analysis.

As an example, these three audios:

"abeja" and "asno" have 3 segments and 4 phonemes.
"amarillo" has 4 segments and 5 phonemes.
